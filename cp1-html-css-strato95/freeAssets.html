     This is one of the subpages of my first creative
     project, freeAssets.html. It describes many
     free assets in unity that have been useful
     for me in the past and why, as well as giving
     links to the assets. The free assets can be 
     good but are usually not as good as paid ones.

<!-- This article describes the objective of this page-->

	<article>
		While paid assets are often the highest quality that can
		be used in a game or application, free assets are often <br>
		sufficient in many circumstances. Often, these are objects
		or other small components of a scene, rather than major <br>
		components such as the environment, or particle effects.
