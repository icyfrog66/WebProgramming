<!-- This section describes an introduction. -->

	<p>
		Because it can be cumbersome to make materials
		from scratch in Unity, it is often preferable to <br>
		use assets from the Unity Asset Store. Many of
		these assets are free, and often these are low-poly<br>
		assets that can fit in mobile applications. However,
		the highest quality assets are often not free.
	</p>

<!-- This section gives tips for the
	assets described on this website. -->

	<article> Tips for the Assets

		<p class="p-article"> Do not download too many: it will take up 
			 too much space. </p>

		<p class="p-article"> Do not download assets that are not easily
			 compatible with new versions of unity. <br>
			 Most likely you will need to delete those
			 assets anyways due to incompatilbility. </p>

		<p class="p-article"> Check all assets for prefabs, in case 
		 	 you want to keep the original version. </p>

		Note: All images of assets are from the 
		<a target="blank" href="https://assetstore.unity.com/"> 
		Unity Asset Store </a> <br>
		and all links to assets direct to the 
		asset page on the unity asset store.
